            <h2>Enzo Documentation</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the documentation for Enzo, your personal health helper chatbot. Enzo is designed to provide
                quick, basic health suggestions based on common symptoms. It's built to be a first point of reference
                for minor ailments and general health inquiries.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symptom-Based Responses:</strong> Enzo recognizes a wide range of common symptoms and offers
                    immediate, actionable advice.</li>
                <li><strong>Typo Tolerance:</strong> The bot attempts to understand your input even with minor spelling
                    errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Developer Shoutouts:</strong> Occasionally, Enzo will mention its creator, Shaik Aman,
                    adding a personal touch.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Health Topic Redirection:</strong> Enzo is focused solely on health; it will gently
                    redirect conversations that stray into other areas like movies or games.</li>
                <li><strong>Speech Input:</strong> Use your voice to interact with Enzo for a hands-free experience.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Use:</strong> Simply type your symptoms or health-related questions into the chat input
                field and press Enter or click the "Send" button. Alternatively, click the microphone icon to speak your
                query. Enzo will process your query and provide a relevant suggestion.</p>
            <p><strong>Important Disclaimer:</strong> Enzo is an AI-powered tool and should not replace professional
                medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment of any health
                condition.</p>

            <h2>Research Behind Enzo</h2>
            <p>Enzo's knowledge base is built upon a curated set of common health symptoms and their corresponding basic
                remedies or advice. The primary goal of this research was to create an accessible and user-friendly
                interface for immediate, non-critical health information.</p>
            <p>The health suggestions provided by Enzo are derived from commonly accepted first-aid practices and
                general wellness guidelines. The development focused on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Ensuring the information is easy to understand for a broad audience.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Relevance:</b> Prioritizing symptoms and conditions that can often be managed with simple
                        home care or require clear guidance on when to seek professional help.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Emphasizing that Enzo is not a substitute for professional medical
                    consultation and encouraging users to seek doctor's advice for serious or persistent symptoms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Future research may involve expanding Enzo's knowledge base with more detailed information, integrating
                with external health resources (with appropriate disclaimers), and exploring natural language processing
                enhancements for more nuanced symptom understanding.</p>
